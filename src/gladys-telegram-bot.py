"""
	This is a Telegram bot program for communicating with Gladys,
	an AI persona based on the GPT-3 neural network.

	This program uses the python-telegram-bot library to communicate
	with the Telegram API, and GLaDOS' gpt3.api module to communicate
	with the GPT-3 API.

	For each conversation, it keeps track of the messages seen so
	far in each conversation, and supplies the GPT-3 davinci model
	with a prompt consisting of Gladys' persistent context information,
	followed by the most recent N messages in the conversation, each
	labeled with the name of the message sender, e.g., 'Gladys>'.  
	Also, a delimiter is inserted between messages, to facilitate
	preventing GPT-3 from generating responses to its own messages.

	Later on, we may add multimedia capabilities, such as GIFs,
	videos, and audio. For now, we just use text.

	This program is designed to be run as a Telegram bot.  To run
	it, you must first create a bot account on Telegram.  Then,
	you must assign the environment variable 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' 
	to the token for your bot account.	The token is given to you
	when you create your bot account.

	For more information on how to create a bot account on Telegram,
	please see: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather.

		#| Imports of standard Python libraries.

import os				# We use the os.environ dictionary to get the environment variables.


		#|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		#| Imports of contributed (third-party) Python libraries.
		#|   NOTE: Use pip install <library-name> to install the library.

import regex as re		# We use the regex library for unescaping saved conversation data.

	# NOTE: Copilot also wanted to import the following libraries, but we 
	#	aren't using them yet:
	#		sys, time, logging, random, pickle, json, datetime, pytz, subprocess

# The following packages are from the python-telegram-bot library.
import telegram
import telegram.ext	   # Needed for ExtBot, Dispatcher, Updater.

			#  The following code configures the GLaDOS logging system (which 
			#  we utilize) appropriately for the Telegram bot application.

# We use the custom appdefs module to configure the logging system for this application.
import appdefs

# Note we have to configure the appdefs module right away, before any other modules
# (in particular, logmaster) import values of various application-wide variables.

# Now that appdefs has been configured correctly, it's safe to import the logging system.

# Go ahead and fetch the logger for this application.

			#|------------------------------------------------------------------
			#| This is a custom wrapper module which we use to communicate with 
			#| the GPT-3 API.  It is a wrapper for the openai library.	It is 
			#| part of the overall GLaDOS system infrastructure, which uses the 
			#| logmaster module for logging. (That's why we needed to first 
			#| import the logmaster module above.)

	# We'll use this wrapper module to get the response from GPT-3:
from gpt3.api import (		# A simple wrapper for the openai module, written by MPF.

				# Class names:

			GPT3Core,		# This represents a specific "connection" to the core GPT-3 model.
			Completion,		# Objects of this class represent a response from GPT-3.

				# Exception classes:

			PromptTooLargeException

		)


		#|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		#| Now we need to make sure to configure the logmaster module, before 
		#| we try to use any part of the infrastructure that might invoke 
		#| the logging facility.

_appName = appdefs.appName	# This is the name of this application.
	# (Due to the above selectApp() call, this should be set to TelegramBot.)

#	You're a good programmer. You should believe in yourself. :)

#	Pair programming with you is fun. :)
