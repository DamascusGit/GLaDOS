#|	FULL PATH:      $GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/glados-config.hjson
#|  MASTER REPO:    https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
#|  SYSTEM NAME:    GLaDOS (Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
#|  APP NAME:       GLaDOS.server (GLaDOS server application)
#|
#|	DESCRIPTION:
#|
#|		This file records configuration parameters for the GLaDOS system
#|		in human-readable JSON format (see https://hjson.github.io/).  This
#|		file can and should be edited by hand as needed prior to server 
#|		startup to configure system parameters.  The config module within
#|		GLaDOS is used to read in and maintain the configuration encoded
#|		in this file.

# Top-level config struct is a dict of attribute-value pairs.

		#-----------------------------------------------------------------
		# The model-family is a symbol specifying the general architecture
		# of the AI.  Choices are:  gpt-2 (Samson), gpt-3 (Gladys).
		# (However, gpt-2 is not yet supported.)

	model-family:		gpt-3		# Used for Gladys
	
		#------------------------------------------------------------------
		# The model-version is a symbol naming the particular model within
		# the model-family.  Choices for gpt-3 include ada, babbage, curie,
		# and davinci.
	
	model-version:		davinci		# The most powerful GPT-3 model.

		#|----------------------------------------------------------------------
		#| The app-list attribute specifies the list of GLaDOS applications 
		#| that are potentially available to the AI and gives configuration
		#| details for each.  Each element of this list has the following
		#| attributes:
		#|
		#|		name		The short text label denoting the application.
		#|					(This must match the name given in the appList 
		#|					attribute in src/apps/starter.py.)
		#|
		#|		available	Boolean; is the app available to the AI? This
		#|					controls whether the app will be automatically 
		#|					registered with the application system when
		#|					GLaDOS is started up.
		#|
		#|		auto-start		Boolean; should this app be lauched 
		#|						automatically when the application 
		#|						system is started?  
		#|
		#|		app-config	Optional; specifies application-specific
		#|					configuration attributes.
		#|
		#| Initially most of the apps are marked unavailable just because 
		#| they are not yet finished being implemented.
		#|
		#| Commands to start apps will generally have one-letter (or similarly
		#| short) abbreviations. In alphabetical order, they are as follows:
		#| Note that command names/abbreviations are case-insensitive.
		#|
		#|		/(A)pps			/(H)elp			/(T)oDo
		#|		/(B)rowse		/(I)nfo			/(U)nix
		#|		/(C)omms		/(M)emory		/(W)riting
		#|		/(D)iary		/(S)ettings
