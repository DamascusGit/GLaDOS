#|
#|	DESCRIPTION:
#|
#|		This file records configuration parameters for the GLaDOS system
#|		in human-readable JSON format (see https://hjson.github.io/).  This
#|		file can and should be edited by hand as needed prior to server 
#|		startup to configure system parameters.  The config module within
#|		GLaDOS is used to read in and maintain the configuration encoded
#|		in this file.

# Top-level config struct is a dict of attribute-value pairs.

		# The model-family is a symbol specifying the general architecture
		# of the AI.  Choices are:  gpt-2 (Samson), gpt-3 (Gladys).
		# (However, gpt-2 is not yet supported.)

	model-family:		gpt-3		# Used for Gladys
	
		#------------------------------------------------------------------
		# The model-version is a symbol naming the particular model within
		# the model-family.  Choices for gpt-3 include ada, babbage, curie,
		# and davinci.
	
	model-version:		davinci		# The most powerful GPT-3 model.

		#|----------------------------------------------------------------------
		#| The app-list specifies the list of GLaDOS applications that are
		#| potentially available to the AI.  Each of these has the following
		#| attributes:
		#|
		#|		name		The short text label for the application
		#|		available	Boolean; is the app available to the AI?
		#|
		#| Initially most of the apps are marked unavailable just because 
		#| they are not yet finished being implemented.
		#|
		#| Commands to start apps generally have one-letter (or similarly
		#| short) abbreviations. In alphabetical order, they are as follows:
		#| Note that command names/abbreviations are case-insensitive.
		#|
		#|		/(A)pps			/(H)elp			/(T)oDo
		#|		/(B)rowse		/(I)nfo			/(U)nix
		#|		/(C)omms		/(M)emory		/(W)riting
