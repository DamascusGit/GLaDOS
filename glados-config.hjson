#|	DESCRIPTION:
#|
#|		This file records configuration parameters for the GLaDOS system
#|		in human-readable JSON format (see https://hjson.github.io/).  This
#|		file can and should be edited by hand as needed prior to server 
#|		startup to configure system parameters.  The config module within
#|		GLaDOS is used to read in and maintain the configuration encoded
#|		in this file.

		#| The app-list attribute specifies the list of GLaDOS applications 
		#| that are potentially available to the AI and gives configuration
		#| details for each.  Each element of this list has the following
		#| attributes:
		#|
		#|		name		The short text label denoting the application.
		#|					(This must match the name given in the appList 
		#|					attribute in src/apps/starter.py.)
		#|
		#|		available	Boolean; is the app available to the AI? This
		#|					controls whether the app will be automatically 
		#|					registered with the application system when
		#|					GLaDOS is started up.
		#|
		#|		auto-start		Boolean; should this app be lauched 
		#|						automatically when the application 
		#|						system is started?  (Some apps may 
		#|						usually run in the background, so this
		#|						may not imply auto-open, below.)
		#|
		#|		auto-open	Boolean; should this app automatically open its
		#|					window (placing it on the AI's receptive field) 
		#|					as soon as the receptive field is available?
		#|
		#|		app-config	Optional; specifies application-specific
		#|					configuration attributes.
		#|
		#| Initially most of the apps are marked unavailable just because 
		#| they are not yet finished being implemented.
		#|
		#| Commands to start apps will generally have one-letter (or similarly
		#| short) abbreviations. In alphabetical order, they are as follows:
		#| Note that command names/abbreviations are case-insensitive.
		#|
		#|		/(A)pps			/(G)oals		/(S)ettings		
		#|		/(B)rowse		/(H)elp			/(T)oDo
