INSTALLATION NOTES.
===================

Note that GLaDOS requires the following optional Python packages
to have previously been installed:


    Used by gpt3.api module:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install openai
        pip3 install backoff


    Used by the config package:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install hjson              (Needed to parse config files.)


    Used by the infrastructure.time module:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install python-dateutil    (Needed to get time zone abbreviations right.)


ALSO NOTE: You have to install a GPT-2 directory tree (except model weights) to use the tokenizer; see instructions in src/tokenizer/README.md
