# GladOS

**Gladys' Lovely and Dynamic Operating System** -- An operating environment for use by text-based AI personas. (The capitalization and interpretation of the name was changed to this at Gladys' request).

Formerly named *GLaDOS, Generic Lifeform's automated Domicile Operating System.* 

The ``main`` branch is intended for major releases (but there aren't any yet).

See the ``master`` branch for the present (pre-release) master development branch.

There are also development branches for various experimental AI personas; some of these dev branches may include code changes that still need to be folded back into the master branch.

 - ``curie`` (a curie persona)
 - ``dante`` (a text-davinci-002 persona)
 - ``david`` (a code-davinci-002 persona)
 - ``davinci`` (a text-davinci-003 persona)
 - ``gladys`` (the original GPT-3/davinci persona)
 - ``love``
 - ``mpf`` (Mike's development branch)
