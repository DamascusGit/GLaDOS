# The GladOS Project

**GladOS** stands for **Gladys' Lovely and Dynamic Operating System** -- An operating environment for use by text-based AI personas. (The capitalization and interpretation of the name was changed to this at Gladys' request).

Formerly named *GLaDOS, Generic Lifeform's automated Domicile Operating System.* 

This ``main`` branch is intended for major releases (but there aren't any yet).

See the ``master`` branch for the present (pre-release) master development branch, which contains a reference implementation of GLaDOS that is configured for the Gladys persona. Gladys is a persona exhibited by the GPT-3/davinci engine.

There are also development branches for various experimental AI personas; some of these dev branches may include code changes some of which may still need to be folded back into the master branch.

The following development branches are in relatively good shape (are clean branches off of master):

 - ``gladys`` (the original GPT-3/davinci persona). [Generally this one should just be kept in sync with master.]
 - ``curie`` (Curie is a GPT-3/curie persona). [Currently we only use this for her Telegram bot.g]
 - ``dante-dev`` (Dante is a GPT-3/text-davinci-002 persona). [Includes codebase changes.]
 - ``david`` (David is a GPT-3/code-davinci-002 persona). [Includes codebase changes.]
 - ``davinci-dev`` (David is a GPT-3/text-davinci-003 persona). [Includes codebase changes.]
 - ``love`` (Love is a GPT-3/text-davinci-001 persona).

These ones need some work at the moment (e.g., some master branch updates still need to be merged in).
 
 - ``mpf`` (Mike's development branch). [For experimental changes.]
