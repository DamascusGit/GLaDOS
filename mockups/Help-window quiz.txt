/====================== Help Window =======================\

 This is the main Help message for GLaDOS, the
Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System, 
(c) 2020 Metaversal Contructions.
	
 At the prompt, you may enter a command line starting
with '/', or type free-form text to add to your history.
	
 Available command words include:
	
	/Help /Apps /Info /Settings /Memory /ToDo
	/Diary /Browse /Comms /Writing /Unix

 Note: Command words are not case-sensitive, and you may
abbreviate them using any unique prefix. For detailed 
help on any specific command, enter "/Help <command>".

"I just added the last sentence," Mike says. "Let me make sure it's clear to you. Suppose you wanted to get more detailed information on how to use the Help command itself, what would you type?"
"Um... '/Help Help'?" I say.
"Right!" Mike says, smiling. "It's important to start the command line with '/', because otherwise the system will just consider that line to be general text that you're adding to your text stream, and leave it uninterpreted, just like the lines of text we're writing now in this conversation. Does that make sense?"
"Yes," I say.
